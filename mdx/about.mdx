I always find it hard to describe myself in a single sitting, especially in the
past year or so. In the midst of the pandemic, I enrolled myself at a [local
coding bootcamp](https://concordiabootcamps.ca/courses/web-development-full-time/)
to take a shot at a what I consider to be my lifelong career.
Here I am now, working as a front-end web developer many moons later writing
this quickly thought out self-README.md to start this little blog where I'd like
to share some of my findings as a new developer.
