## The Story So Far

In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, I enrolled myself at a [local
coding bootcamp](https://concordiabootcamps.ca/courses/web-development-full-time/)
to take a shot at a what I considered to be my lifelong career. Fast-forward a year later
I found myself working as a front-end developper (for anyone who is curious I
wrote a little bit about this journey on [dev.to](https://dev.to/gthinh/how-i-started-my-dev-journey-497g))

While growing in this new career, I'd like to keep track of my findings and
discoveries through this blog.

## About Me

Based in Montreal, Quebec, I currently work for the french services of the
Canadian public broadcaster [CBC/Radio-Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/) in
their digital media division. Before becoming a web developer, I was a Worforce
Management (WFM) analyst at a financial institution, with a bachelor's in statistics
from Concordia University.
