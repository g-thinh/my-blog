## The Story So Far

In the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, I enrolled myself at a [local
coding bootcamp](https://concordiabootcamps.ca/courses/web-development-full-time/)
to take a shot at a what I considered to be my lifelong career. Fast-forward a year later
I found myself working as a front-end developper (for anyone who is curious I
wrote a little bit about this journey on [dev.to](https://dev.to/gthinh/how-i-started-my-dev-journey-497g))

While growing in this new career, I'd like to keep track of my findings and
discoveries through this blog.

## About Me

Based in Montreal, Quebec, I currently work for the french services of the
Canadian public broadcaster [CBC/Radio-Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/) in
their digital media division. Before becoming a web developer, I was a Worforce
Management (WFM) analyst at a financial institution, with a bachelor's in statistics
from Concordia University.

## What I'm Learning These Days

Lately, I've been digging back at my roots as a full-stack developer. While having
learnt a great deal about frontend development and tooling, I want to be able to 
build blazing fast web apps that make use of the latest backend technologies.

Some of the tech I've been exploring lately include:

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is an amazing framework for building scalable
RESTful APIs. It's opinionated and extremely well documented, I plan on making this
my de-facto backend framework of choice for now.
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) are ORMs
I've been looking into to help me bridge the gap between creating API endpoints
and conducting database transaction with ease. Having mostly used TypeScript for 
frontend projects, this felt like a must learn for me.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open source project that caught my
attention recently. Not only does it provide a cloud instance of a PostgresSQL
in its generous free tier, there are a ton of exciting features coming soon that
I want to explore.
