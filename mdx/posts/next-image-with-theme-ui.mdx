Next.js comes packed with optimizations, notably with images since version 10
got released. This is ideal for web apps with tons of media content such as 
images. Essentially, instead of images being optimized at build time, they are
lazy loaded by default (meaning they are loaded as users scroll).

These are some huge benefits, and we definitely want them rolling with our Theme-UI
project. Since `next/image` already provides a React component to use, we can 
wrap around with an incredibly useful Theme-UI component called the `<AspectRatio>`. 
As the name aptly implies, this component preserves the aspect ratio of any image it wraps
around through its `ratio` prop.

Taking a look at the code, we come up with the following:

```typescript title="Image.tsx"
import NextImage from "next/image";
import { AspectRatio } from "@theme-ui/components";

type ImageProps = React.ComponentProps<typeof NextImage> &
  React.ComponentProps<typeof AspectRatio>;

export function Image({ ratio, ...props }: ImageProps) {
  if (!ratio) {
    return <NextImage {...props} />;
  }

  return (
    <AspectRatio ratio={ratio}>
      <NextImage {...props} />
    </AspectRatio>
  );
}
```

And voil√†! We have our `<Image>` component ready to use. There is no particular
magic behind this component, it actually uses a well-known padding trick to 
calculate the appropriate width/height for the image. `NextImage` will naturally
takes whatever space is available using the `layout` prop with the value of `fill`.

<Image
  src={frontmatter.backgroundImage}
  ratio={4/3}
  alt="Photo by Thomas Le"
  caption="A Next/Image with layout fill"
  layout="fill"
  mb={4}
/>

Of course, we should also be able to choose a width or height using the component
itself if no aspect ratio is passed.

<Flex mb={4} sx={{justifyContent:'center'}}>
  <Image
  src={frontmatter.backgroundImage}
  alt="Photo by Thomas Le"
  caption="A regular 300x250 Next/Image"
  width={300}
  height={250}
/>
</Flex>

And that's really it, you now have a versatile component to render images at any
size.
